The map that I did for Welding was well received by my boss but also had some critisism. It lacked specific landmarks that could help them when planning which route to take. Also it lacked basic roads and highways.

I tried to insert key cities like Nairobi, Kisumu and Mombasa, but the lack on roads and highways was still an issue that I needed to fix.

After a little research I came accross a map of Kenya with all roads highlighted. This work was done by Kenya Roads Board and available free online for me to use. I think its commendable for the government to do such to help us use the data.

The dataset is called Kenya Road Network - as mapped by the Kenya Roads Board. The main objective of KRB is to oversee the road network in Kenya and thereby coordinate its development, rehabilitation and maintenance and to be the principal adviser to the Government on all matters related thereto.

The tricky part here is how do I use this dataset in Python Basemap?
