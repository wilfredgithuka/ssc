This training project’s content covers civil engineering domain syllabus.
It separately covers construction drawing, soil strength and foundation basics,
construction materials, engineering survey, building and construction technology.
The curriculum teaching is for practical guide, practical aspect and replace
technical schools.  After the training, the trainee shall be able to use CAD
to make a drawing, dimensional drawing and projections, soil engineering
quality, organic building materials, inorganic building materials, building
products, optics measurements, GPS measurement and construction technology of
different building structures. Quality testing and multiaspect theory knowledge
and practical operation knowledge skills, widen the scope of the trainee,
promote engineering technology and synthesize application ability.
