考试日 Exam Date: October 2019

When this year started I made a plan to prepare for HSK 6 this year and
hopefully pass it. The plan is still good and am feeling some changes
in my reading. I set quite high goals when starting off but its slowly
paying off.

Among the thing that I started doing was reading a lot of Chinese and I
selected the following books to help me do that:

* 农民为什么离开土地

be linking into as I prepare daily for my exam.
