Last week my supervisor requested me to prepare a presentation which
I would later give my fellow workmates on how to manage a successful training.

The annual trainings are almost starting and these days we are quite busy doing
the final translations before setting off.

We are 4 of us and each shall have their own disciplines to manage. Last year
I was translating Welding Technology so this year I will be incharge of Agriculture
Value Addition, which am very interested to learn.

The training was basically giving them some tips based on my experience at [Kisii National Polytechnic](https://chinese.gihtuka.com/blog/graduation)
for the Welding Technology training. I was a difficult training but I got a chance to learn alot when
it comes to managing the whole training project.

It was a good time standing before my colleagues and sharing my experience
and my mistakes so that they don't have to make them too.

That I can say was a highlight of the week.

Back to code...Project Update: The [mapping project](https://chinese.githuka.com/blog/ditu/) was well received though am still stuck at
the mapping roads and landmarks step. I hope to be done with this since my exams are starting on
Tuesday which means I will be quite busy for the next 2 weeks.

I have taken leave from work do sit for my exams so I guess I can squeeze some time to finish
the mapping project.
