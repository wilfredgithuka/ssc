This is the 16th Week Work Report and the 8th report which I have done in LaTeX. Its been a steep learning curve but slowly am getting the flow and every week's document produced is a correction of the previous's problems. Its very fascinating how code can be used to produce such standard, professional-looking documents, far from what other document processing softwares can do.

I don't think there is really a comparison between Ms Word and LaTeX. Each has their own places of application in desktop publishing. I like LaTeX because of the production environment especially since am a Linux user who wants to be incontrol of everything. My environment is very simple: emacs-->tex-->pdf

My environment contains Chinese characters, I have explained how to work with
them here when you are working with non-Latin based languages.

## This Week's Document Features:
* Inline Images - I tried to insert an image in-between text. It worked but the 
text is not going round the image well. I used the wrapfig package.
* Document size at: 7.5MB
* QR Code is still working well. Generated by LaTeX

Thats all for this week's report. I hope to perfect the inline images well because this is a key part of most thesis and scientific documents.

人生未就是为了出众的，你为什么老费劲去合群呢？
