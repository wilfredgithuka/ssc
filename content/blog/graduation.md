Finally after many months (5 months) the training's graduation was held today. The colorful ceremony
was held today at the hall at Kisii National Polytechnic's hall. In attendance was the State Department
of Vocational and Technical Education (TVET) together with the other principals who were in attendance,
the day was a success.

Even though today was the graduation, we still have another few days of the training to go before we can
complete the training.
