During the introduction of Co2 Arch Welding last week, it was my harddest
interpretation. I was new to the equipment and so were the trainees. There were
no reference material so It was hard understanding how the machine operated.

So over the weekend I seerched on the Manufacturers website where I came accross
the manual, but in Chinese.
