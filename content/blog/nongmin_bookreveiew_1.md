I got hold of this book back in 2014 when I was in Nanjing from Librairie Avant-Garde in Wutaishan. They had a great collection of books and am sure they still have up-to now. I have decided to pick up this book and read it carefully since it shall be good material for my HSK 6 exam which I plan to do in October this year.

As the title says 农民为什么离开土地 is a book that seeks to question more about the rural-urban migration in China. 农民 is a peasant/migrant farmer who are leaving the countryside/village or rural areas to move to the big cities. Since 1979, China's urban population has grown by about 440 million to 622 million in 2009. This was attributable mostly to the rural-urban migration.

This first page came in with 5 idioms 成语　which would be a put off to many starters who are venturing into characters reading. This first of many reviews later on shall be highlighting the many aspects of the book and what key language and grammar that I am learning along the way.

### New Words:
* 否则 fǒu zé －　Otherwise, If Not, Or Else. Usage: 父母对孩子讲的最多的是“好好学习，否则就只能当农民
* 树立shù lì－ Set/Be an example. Usage:　树立的一个又一个榜样
* 守土shǒu tǔ　－　Defend ones country. Usage: 我们首先联想到的就是农民　“守土”
* 守常 shǒu cháng　－　Usage: ...”守常”，观念。农民不会轻易离开自己热爱的土地...
* 朝起暮栖　zhāo qǐ mù qī　－ Sovereign, Evening Dwelling Place. Usage: 朝起暮栖的家园
* 民工潮mín gōng cháo － Ｗorkers Demonstration.
 

### 成语 Chinese Idioms:
* 北进离乡Leave ones home unwillingly
* 妻离子散 Break up, Scatter one’s family
* 四处漂泊 Wander in all directions
* 居无定所 Have no specific/fixed residence
* 衣衫褴褛 In Rags


### Interesting Sections

Besides the specific language and grammar points above, there are some sentences that I think are worth 
mentioning in the way the author has tried to portray his idea.

* 在我们调查中，无论东北还是西南，最常听到的一个说法就是：“除非傻子留在农村”
* 每年春节前后，无论你在旅途，还是在电视里，一低昂都曾经过浩浩荡荡的农民工队伍　

So that was all about the book review, let me get back to reading. I will do another review when I cover more ground or when I meet
some content that is worth sharing. Make no mistake, am not a good reader until I can complete this book so if you are a good
reader you can help me by suggesting ways I can be good at reading.

Thanks.
