### Getting to the school

Lari TVC is located in Kwaregi village, Lari subcountry of the vast Kiambu County.
The school can be accessed by road from Uplands junction on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway.

Its a one hour drive from Nairobi. If using public means, just take a matatu 
for Nyambari from the Limuru stage next to Khoja Roundabout. 

Its about Ksh.100 to Nyambari. On arriving Nyambari, take another
matatu and tell the conductor to drop you at Lari TVC or Kwaregi Catholic Church.
The matatus go very slow due to the condition of the road which is earthen.

During the rainy season, take caution, since some parts are impassable.
