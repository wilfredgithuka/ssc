So far in the training we have been working with the 2.5 and 3.2 mm diameter type of welding rods. For sometime I have been keen to note that they all have
the 结　character next to the type number. Also this has been translated as "J" which is also used to show the number J40.50.

Yesterday I asked one of the Chinese teachers who explained to me that it stands for 结构钢　jiegougang which means Structural Steel. 结构　mean structure, while 钢　is simply steel.

Thare you have it :－）
