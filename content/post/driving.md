This is a first or a series of posts about improving my Chinese knowledge about
automomous cars, more so 无人驾驶汽车技术。 

无人驾驶汽车是智能汽车的一种，也称为轮式移动机器人，主要依靠车内的以计算机系统为主的智能驾驶仪来实现无人驾驶的目的。

Its all about a video that I came accross about Self Driving Cars which was
entitled [无人驾驶汽车里我们有多元](http://www.kankanews.com/a/2017-07-07/0018061898.shtml)。 This project is just like providing Chinese
subtitles to the video. I hope by listening to all they say and noting it down,
I will increase by technical knowledge on autonomous vehicles 2 fold. It a fun and 
at the same time interesting project

## The main objectives behind this are as follows:主要的目标

* Create a vocabulary bank of technical terms related to Self Driving Cars in Chinese.
* To have debating & explanation skills in Chinese
* To improve spoken Chinese
* To improve written Chinese since I have to script the while clip
* To improve listening skills by listening as many times until I hear 100%
* To improve my presentation skills and confidence

## Implementation 实施

* Listen 听
* Listen Again 在听
* Listen More 在听一下
* Then write what you have heard 写上你听到的内容
* Completion: Late March 2020

## Clip Details

* Total Video Length: 01:03:24
* Video Format: .mkv
* Video Size: 344.9MB

## 中-英 Artificial Intelligence Terminology

There is a great [Github](https://github.com/wilfredgithuka/Artificial-Intelligence-Terminology) repo which contails a long list of AI terminologies translated
into Chinese. Its a wealth of info for any budding IT guru who wants to transit between
Chinese and English. It shall be a good reference kit for this project so I thought it be
wise to mention it here.

## 项目指数

### 下载视频

这个视频是来自-[新看看](http://www.kankanews.com/a/2017-07-07/0018061898.shtml)-的网站。你可以使用你选择的应用下载该视频。 

### 转换格式至语音

下载后你会发现视频的大小比较大，不方便放在手机上随时看。我建议你可以转换他到语音。.mp3 的大小比较小。

### [00:00:00-00:00:40](https://chinese.githuka.com/driving_one)

这个部分的内容我发现了内容不太难。因为还是女士说话。

### 00:00:40-00:01.00
