WPS Office suite is by far the best office suite on Linux, it integrates well with the Linux ecosystem and has a striking resemblance like Microsoft's Office suite. WPS Office suite is also available for mobile devices as can pretty much do what MS Office can do, but whats even much better is that its completely free.

One good thing is that its widely used in China which makes it my choice when it comes to handling Chinese Characters well.On Archlinux, its available on AUR and this is how to go about when installing it.

#### Installation

The installation is pretty straight forward. Just run the following commands

```console
yaourt wps
```
After the installation, start WPS Word, WPS Spreadsheets or WPS Presentation and you are good to go.
