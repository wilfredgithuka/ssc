百度百科 defines an amoured vehicle 云钞车　as 应用于银行业务之中，是专为武装押运量身订
做的防弹运送钞票的专用车辆。它不属于特种车，应当遵守交通规则和交警指. This simply means
that its a special vehicle(which must abide by the traffic code) that is used
for moving bank notes which need armed escorts. The vehicle is bullet proof 
防掸　and its mostly used in the banking industry.

The Chinese character for an amoured vehicle can be broken up like below
for a clear understanding:

*运yùn - motion,transport,carry,luck
*钞chāo - money
*车chē - car, vehicle

As you can see the character for money is 钞chāo. It has the radical Jìn for metals.
Reason being that in the olden times　esp in the Jin Dynasty Chinese money used to be 
made out of metals.  

And just for knowledge, this character appears in the word 纸钞屋 zhǐchāowū which is the Chinese
translation for Money House - La Passa De Papel (Money Heist) movie.
