I didnt even notice that we have already hit a month here at Kisii County.
The days have moved on quite at a pace so I thought it be wise to do
a recap of how the month was.
<!--more-->

I have never studied Welding Technology or Metullargy that what I have been
doing for the last 30 days or so. It has been a month of going through knowledge
that I once saw on Wikipedia. To make it even more interesting all that in Chinese.

That is basically what I do, and have been doing since July. 

The Welding Training started in July and will be running for 5 months until November
this year. We started with a few teething problems but for now everything has been
ironed out and the training is running smoothly.

My main objective is to be able to improve my character reading speed by November.

### Translation/Interpretation

On a fine day we have theoretical and practical classes. During the theoretical classes
I stand next to the Chinese teacher and basically interpretate consecutively all he says
from Chinese to English. This is preety easy on general communication but when technical
terms are involved, I have to be in sync with him so that I get the clear meaning.

For the practical lessons, we are down in the workshop where the Teacher demostrates while
I interpret. This is where quick thinking is needed. Welding is a heat intesive processing
method. Combine heat and a fast working Chinese then that is your working environment. 

When the training stared, it was a challenge because I had to get used to the teacher's
method and of speaking but one month down the lane, its gotten clearer. Also the concepts
and terminology had to sink in fast. I have developed my own org plan to help me with this.

### Reading

I love Chinese Characters, thats good but there is nothing bad like when you are reading
some text flowing like a native then you come accross this character halts your speed 
and breaks your flow. Its like a syntax error that throws errors.
