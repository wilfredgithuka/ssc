A summary of what I have learnt so far by mixing Linux+LaTeX+汉子=Work Report
this week. 

<!--more-->

For some time I have migrated slowly from click-based document processing 
softwares like Ms Word to more text based document processing softwares like 
LaTeX.

LaTeX is a powerful, yet free document procesing software that is used in 
scientific documents because of its flexible rendering capability.

I decided to incorporate LaTeX into my workflow and the results have been
amazing. My weekly work reports are now in pure LaTeX which spits out a neat
ISO standard PDF(All in a Linux environment). I have also configured it to write Chinese characters and so far the rendering is great.

## Week 9 Work Report Changelog
* Added header and footer of company logo: In LaTeX the header and footer
capability is handled by the fancyhdr package. The explantions on their page
are quite easy to understand.
* File size shot to 11MB. I think this is too high for a 3 page report. Am
still new to LaTeX but I think that I need to tame that file size. For now
I suspect its the images on the first page that are causing the file to be
heavy...
