乐观的人像太阳找到哪里哪里亮，消极的人像月亮初一十五不一样

Optimistic people be like the sun, they find where to light, while
pessimistic/passive people tend to be like the moon, they change fast 
and are quite inconsistent.
<!--more-->

This is an idiom/phrase that I learnt sometime back. It talks of 
乐观的人, people who are optimistic. They tend to be like the
sun 太阳, which shines bright hence they know where to shine/prosper.

On the other hand, 消极的人 are negative/pessismistic people who don't see any
opportunity, hence they are like the moon 月亮, which changes every 15 days. 
初一十五不一样, they are quite inconsistent.

So are you a 乐观的人or a 消极的人?

Tafakari ya babu :-)
