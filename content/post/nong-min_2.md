February has been quite busy for me so I have not been consistently reading as I would have wanted to. Due to this my reading schedule has been affected. This week I plan to pick up momentum to get back to my reading habit.

The last book review was in January and can be found here. This second book review spans from page 3 to page 7.

## Summary

The story continues to explain the reasons why 农民人 still insist on moving from the country side to the big cities. In page 3 the writer talks about the state of the life the peasants lives as just surviving. The writer uses the characters 农民的生活其实只能算的上生存。Much of page 3 talks about the pressures that the peasants are facing when they live in the farmlands. To show how much pressure the young generation is facing to leave the farmlands, the writer says: 父母对孩子讲的最多的是 “好好学习否则就只能当农民”。教师教育学生也是 “考不上大学，没有出息，就只能当农民了”。 一个离家出走去拜师学习种地的女孩子告诉我说，由于高考失利，家长，老师，亲戚，邻居，同学 都给他施加压力，使她没有在村里生活下去的空间

Page 4 to 7 talks of a character called 邓津。邓津 lives with his parents in the country side and they are quite poor. He lives with his 80year old 瘫痪(paralyzed) grandmother and 2 small brothers who are 24 and 19 respectively. The writer explains how they go about their day in the harsh conditions and constant rain.

邓津 leaves home for the city to try and eke out a living but things do not turn out well for him there. In Page 7 邓津 also leaves his home for 太原 for seek his luck again.
