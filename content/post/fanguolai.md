The trainees are catching up some simple Chinese terms, am glad.

<!--more-->

Today being a Monday, we had the theoretical class 理论课 as usual and the practical class 实训课at around　10am.　I managed to write last weeks work report in LaTeX all here on Spacemacs. This was after weeks of toiling hard trying to set up this environment+Chinese charaters support. Anyway the pdf output was great, but thats for another post. 

So These days I have noticed something rather interesting, our trainees are quickly learning some simple Chinese pharases as they go about during the normal training routine. One of the catch phrases is fan guo lai 反过来.

The Chinese phrase 反过来　simply means, turn over. This is mostly used when we are talking about the two sides of I shaped welding type. One has to do intermittent welding on one side then 反过来　and so flat butt welding on the other. 

When am interpreting especially for the practical class, I use some simple Chinese phrases which we both understand with the trainees. I interpret from Chinese to English and vice versa. 

So when am translating from Chinese to English, the following phrases/words have become so common that the trainees actually understand them. So common have they that the trainees sometimes have an idea what the Chinese teacher has said long before I start interpreting.

Here are the words/phrase:

* 反过来　Turn over
* 平付焊　Ｆlat welding
* 你好　Ｈello
* 开门　Open door
* 关门 Close door

Although their tones might not be correct, I feel that they are making their
effort learning some bit of Chinese. I was once there during my first days of learning Chinese so I know how much effort is required to get the tones right.

Good work teachers.
