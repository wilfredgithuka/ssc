Pleco has always been my number 1 app when studying Chinese. I have tried others but none comes close. This tutorial is to explain how to import custom made cards into Pleco and at the same time creating a category to the same effect. My environment is Linux, Archlinux so Windows users might find some steps not necessary since on Windows, everything is done for you.

### Step 1: Create Flashcard
My flashcard is called Welding Technology. The Chinese characters are on a list with their meanings alongside each character set. Its basically a list of upto 300 charcaters mainly about welding technology which I need to memorize. After inspecting the list, I realsied one thing, there is no pinyin, its just a character and english explanation affair. Before exporing the list to Pleco, I need the pinyin too to help me as I learn the new words.

The first thing I do is Copy-Paste all the words on a text file to remove any formatting details that Word might have. This leaves me with a clean list of the characters and their English meanings.

### Step 2: Pinyin
This is perhaps the trickiest step. Its also the most tiring. The guys over at
[Chinese Converter]{https://www.chineseconverter.com} have a good Charcaters to Pinyin converter.Copy-Paste the characters into the tool and it will give you a pinyin output. Pleco will read pinyin with the tone marks of with the number marks like this pin2yin4. Once you have your list of pinyin, copy them into a text file for more editing. 

### Step 3: Upload to Pleco
