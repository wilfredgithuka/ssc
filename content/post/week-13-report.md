This week's work report was fairly simple. The main target-type of content that I wanted to put on the report was tables, that is how to create amazing tables in LaTeX. This turned out to be crazily difficult since I was working from the code of another complete LaTeX document. The kind of tables I wanted was the interchanging black and white for alternate rows. I gave this up and pushed it to next weeks report for Week 14.

This week's report came in at 9.5MBs heavy. I really drop in file size from last weeks report. To reduce the file size I have been reducing the size of the images depite hopping to add more images to future reports. Well, most of the reports are generally about welding 焊接 so they have alot of light flashes, which make them good looking.
