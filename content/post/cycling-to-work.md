I cycle to work [grin smile] and I think its cool. I do it simply because:

* Its good healthwise.
* Gives me a kick in the morning
* I never fit well in the matatu/busses especially the City Hoppa since my legs are too long and shoulders are broad.

Cycling to work is cool knowing that you save alot in terms of transport but in reality, a bike is a machine
and riding it daily really does some damage to the moving parts which need good taking care of.

One must be a good DIY spirited persons since most of the repairs you will have to do them personally and ONLY after
you can't then take it to the bike fundi(repairman)

## Essential Kits(City Communters)

* Bike pump.
* Puncture repair kit.
* Elastoplast and some little antiseptic.
