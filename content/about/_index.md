Wilfred Githuka 楚大洋

Hey there, thank you for landing on my site. Am a Chinese Language Technical
Interpreter and Trainer and here I write about my experiece while at it.

大家好，我叫楚大洋，欢迎大家来到我的技术博客。

热爱自动驾驶，目前钻研机器学习和数据挖掘。我基本用python写代码，当然也会在Ros下用c++写一些东西。

### Linux and OpenSource Software

I use ArchLinux on a daily basis, its not easy using Linux in a Chinese work 
environment because of few unsupported sofware. One has to preety much tweak
everything to get it working. I love that.

On this website I explain my tweaking process and also post a tutorials on how
to go about this.

Lets face it, Chinese is hard but really interesting.
