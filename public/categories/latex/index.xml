      <description>This is the 16th Week Work Report and the 8th report which I have done in LaTeX. Its been a steep learning curve but slowly am getting the flow and every week&amp;rsquo;s document produced is a correction of the previous&amp;rsquo;s problems. Its very fascinating how code can be used to produce such standard, professional-looking documents, far from what other document processing softwares can do.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think there is really a comparison between Ms Word and LaTeX.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An analysis for my second work report which I did in LaTeX and what I have
learnt so far as compared to the first one last week. Archlinux + Spacemacs + LaTeX + Chinese Characters = My Work Environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After weeks and weeks of toiling on the terminal, I finally finished a piece
of my Linux workflow. I managed to have Chinese Characters input using
搜狗输入法 to work in Spacemacs and have the same output in LaTeX.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
