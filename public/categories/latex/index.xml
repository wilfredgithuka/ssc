      <description>For a while now I have been pondering on how I can add a cover page to my weekly report to make it look more presentable. It will also give me more room to write content that would other have to be dropped onto the next page. This weekend I dug up on my Latex documentation to find out how I can add a cover page. It was however no straight forward as I thought, but I found workarounds.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An analysis for my second work report which I did in LaTeX and what I have

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After weeks and weeks of toiling on the terminal, I finally finished a piece
of my Linux workflow. I managed to have Chinese Characters input using
搜狗输入法 to work in Spacemacs and have the same output in LaTeX.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
