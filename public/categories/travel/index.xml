      <description>After a wonderful time at Sotik, the trainees again organaised a trip to Kisumu to see the city and visit Lake Victoria among other attractions on Saturday the 17th November 2018. This time round the Chinese teachers accompanied us. The day was amazing. I have never been to the lakeside city of Kisumu. Our trainees are drawn from different parts of the country and this time the ones who hailed from Kisumu took us on a tour of the city.</description>
