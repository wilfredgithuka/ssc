<p>神手钥钱，我们的焊接培训马上就开始了。准备好了吗？</p>

<p>In a few days we will be heading to the Western highlands of Kisii for the 3rd Training in Welding Technology. Here at the office
its been all about preparations as I ravage through the materials to make sure I get a clear understanding of the subject matter.
We will be going four of us.</p>

<h2 id="training">Training</h2>

<p>I have only touched welding as a sub-topic in Electrical Engineering, so am wading in new waters. All the same its quite
interesting. For this training, I hope to polish my listening and reading Chinese skills. There is also an opportuity for me to
get some managerial skills to manage the trainees&rsquo; affairs making sure they get the best of the training.</p>

<p>The training will start on Monday the 9th day of July 2018 until October this year. We will be based in Kisii National Polytechnic from
where we will be conducting the practical and theoretical classes.</p>

<p>The training will be conducted by 2 Lectuers from China.</p>

<p>I will be doing consequtive translation/interpretation for the course. [zh-en-zh]</p>

<p>Consecutive interpreting is when a speaker pauses to allow an interpreter to repeat what has been said in the target language before continuing.</p>

<p>In such areas like the training, prior preparation before the class is necessary to deliver a smooth interpretation.</p>

<h2 id="pleco-cards">Pleco Cards</h2>

<p>During the last 2 months of preparation, I have developed a near-perfect Pleco Flash Cards study workflow which I wish to share with
those who might be doing the same. I will explain more on that in a later post.</p>

<h2 id="kisii-town">Kisii Town</h2>

<p>There is alot to know about Kisii town and the rich culture that the Abagusii have been bestowed upon. There is however very little on
the interet to show about it so I think I will write about that too.</p>

<p>Its time to get packing. The office was good but now lets get our feet wet with the work.</p>
