      <p>Last week my supervisor requested me to prepare a presentation which
I would later give my fellow workmates on how to manage a successful training.</p>

<p>The annual trainings are almost starting and these days we are quite busy doing
the final translations before setting off.</p>

<p>We are 4 of us and each shall have their own disciplines to manage. Last year
I was translating Welding Technology so this year I will be incharge of Agriculture
Value Addition, which am very interested to learn.</p>

<p><img src="/img/presentation.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>The training was basically giving them some tips based on my experience at <a href="https://chinese.gihtuka.com/blog/graduation">Kisii National Polytechnic</a>
for the Welding Technology training. I was a difficult training but I got a chance to learn alot when
it comes to managing the whole training project.</p>

<p>It was a good time standing before my colleagues and sharing my experience
and my mistakes so that they don&rsquo;t have to make them too.</p>

<p>That I can say was a highlight of the week.</p>

<p>Back to code&hellip;Project Update: The <a href="https://chinese.githuka.com/blog/ditu/">mapping project</a> was well received though am still stuck at
the mapping roads and landmarks step. I hope to be done with this since my exams are starting on
Tuesday which means I will be quite busy for the next 2 weeks.</p>

<p>I have taken leave from work do sit for my exams so I guess I can squeeze some time to finish
the mapping project.</p>
