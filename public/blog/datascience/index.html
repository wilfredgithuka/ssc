<p>After spending a good easter weekend becoming familiar with shapefiles in
python basemap, it is clear that there was alot that I have to learn
in order to map the schools well.</p>

<p>This is a part of a series of posts of my project to map technical training schools according to the equipments that they have. I suggest you look at these posts then follow on to know what am talking about:</p>

<h2 id="data-structures">Data Structures</h2></li>
</ul>

<p>In CS data structures are ways to organaize data in a computer that makes t computationaly efficient. Data structures are very important and really shows the think pattern that the programmer used to arrive at the solution. In maping I will talk about 3 parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Python Lists</li>
<li>Python Tuples</li>
<li>Python Dictionaries</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="python-lists">Python Lists</h3>

<p>Python list is a most versatile datatype available in Python which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Important thing about a list is that items in a list need not be of the same type. Python lists are designated with square brackets.</p>

<pre><code>a = []
b = ['me', 'you','wo'i]
</code></pre>

<p>In lists, the value of the first item is a 0. So to check the contents of a list, you can pass this statement.</p>

<pre><code>b[1]
</code></pre>

<p>Which will give: you</p>

<h3 id="python-tuples">Python Tuples</h3>

<p>A tuple is like a list but its immutable. Not changeable. A tuple is represented by brackets as opposed to lists which have square brackets. Tuples are therefore good for storing immutable values like the GPS co-ordinates for the various schools that I need to map. :-). Working with tuples is preety easy:</p>

<pre><code>a = ()
b = (32, 41)
c = ('x', 'y')
</code></pre>

<p>To access an element in a tuple, simply issue the following command:</p>

<pre><code>b[1]
</code></pre>

<p>Which will result: 41</p>

<h3 id="python-dictionaries">Python Dictionaries</h3>

<p>Also known as associative arrays, maps, symbols tables or hash tables. Dictionaries are computationaly fast but on the other hand use alot of memory. They contain key:value pairs. Here is an example on working with dictionaries.</p>

<pre><code>dict_a = {}
dict_b = {'Hey Wilfred':'How are you?'}
</code></pre>

<p>In the above example, the key is: Hey Wilfred and the value is: How are you. Once you understand this, then you can call the key like this:</p>

<pre><code>dict_b['Hey Wilfred']
</code></pre>

<p>This will result: &lsquo;How are you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>After understanding this concepts, we can now go to preparing the data.</p>

<p>Remember, if you have any issues on Python, always go to the python documentation page which has tonnes of info which I think will be of great help before stack-overflow.</p>

<p>Back to code :-)</p>
