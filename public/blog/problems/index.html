<p>The following are some of the issues which remain unsolved so far in my ArchLinux i3 Chinese
machine. Some are language specific, some are just system based configuration.</p>

<h2 id="no-chinese-input-support-in-spacemacs">No Chinese Input Support in Spacemacs</h2>

<p>This is by far the biggest issue am yet to solve. Last year I remeber solving this issue
but because I did not document my process, after re-installing Archlinux I have to do it again.</p>

<p>Here is where the importance of documenting one&rsquo;s progress.</p>

<p>I have however made some attempt and you can read my <a href="https://chinese.githuka.com/blog/emacs_chinese_input/">thought process here</a></p>

<p>There is still no success. But am working on it.</p>

<h2 id="solved-windows-size-out-of-screen">[SOLVED]Windows Size Out Of Screen</h2>

<p>The dialog box is always out of resolution and sometimes I cannot see the file name especially when saving a document from
the internet. I suppose this is a Chromium issue, but its very frustrating.</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>

<p>The maximum and minimum dimensions of floating windows can be specified. If either dimension of floating_maximum_size is specified as -1, that dimension will be unconstrained with respect to its maximum value. If either dimension of floating_maximum_size is undefined, or specified as 0, i3 will use a default value to constrain the maximum size. floating_minimum_size is treated in a manner analogous to floating_maximum_size.</p>

<p>A more simpler solution is to just hold the <code>mod+right-click</code> when the window pops up the drag to resize to the appropriate size.</p>

<p>Problem Solved.</p>

<h2 id="no-chinese-input-support-in-terminal-zsh">No Chinese Input Support in Terminal - Zsh</h2>

<p>I still dont have Chinese charcter support in oh-my-zsh. I think its a fonts problem since I can input Chinese characters
but they show up as boxes.</p>

<h2 id="copy-paste-issues-in-zsh">Copy Paste Issues in Zsh</h2>

<p>How does one copy-paste in oh-my-zsh?</p>

<h2 id="printer-suport-is-having-issues-blank-page-printout">Printer Suport is Having Issues. Blank Page Printout</h2>

<p>This I tend to think its a driver issue for the printer. When I send a file to the printer, I get a blank output while
the printer goes into a printing frenzy.</p>

<h2 id="wechat-support-alternative-in-archlinux">WeChat Support/alternative in ArchLinux</h2>

<p>The Linux <a href="https://github.com/geeeeeeeeek/electronic-wechat">Wechat app</a> that I used to have is no longer maintained. 项目不再维护.
There is a tutorial here on <a href="https://www.linuxbabe.com/desktop-linux/install-wechat-linux">Linux Babe</a> which I will try out later.</p>

<h2 id="pdf-preview-support-in-ranger">PDF Preview support in Ranger</h2>

<p>Ranger is an awesome file manager. I know that It has an awesome PDF preview. Oh-my-zsh I think it should have a PFD preview which
should come in handy when scanning many documents.</p>

<h2 id="solved-android-usb-tethering-support">[Solved] Android USB Tethering Support</h2>

<p>This issue I have since resolved it well and you can read the solution <a href="https://chinese.githuka.com/blog/filemanager/">here</a></p>

<h2 id="projector-connection-issue">[Projector Connection Issue]</h2>

<p>Projector connection is not so straightforward as it is on Windows. However after reading some online documentation, am almost
there to attain successful connection to a projector. This might come in handy if am told to give a presentation in the future.
There is an application called <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=arandr">arandr</a> that should simply the process according to the
documentation for <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xrandr">xrandr</a></p>
