      <p>Its not everyday when someone appreiciates your hard work. The feeling that comes with this is amazing, knowing that you did your best. The trainees at our training are a wonderful lot. I was invited to one of the trainee&rsquo;s home, where there was a goat eating ceremony which was organaised by the trainees. The bond and homliness that I saw there despite all of us coming from diffrent parts of the country, and different cultures was warm. We prayed, learnt how to slaughter, skin, boil and roast meat.</p>

<p>During the day we had sessions where some the planning commitee and family members shared on the progress and also about the training.</p>

<p>Sotik lies in the larger Bomet county and its a 1.5hour drive from Kisii Town.</p>

<p>Mr. Rotich&rsquo;s family is very humble and the location of the home is in a very serine environment. One does not have to understand a language to see love flowing in a family. The home is very beautiful and the land is quite fertile.</p>

<p>The day was well planned and we should do this again,</p>

<p>Thank you to Mr. Rotich and the organaising commitee</p>
