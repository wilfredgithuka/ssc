      <description>So far in the training we have been working with the 2.5 and 3.2 mm diameter type of welding rods. For sometime I have been keen to note that they all have the 结　character next to the type number. Also this has been translated as &amp;ldquo;J&amp;rdquo; which is also used to show the number J40.50.
Yesterday I asked one of the Chinese teachers who explained to me that it stands for 结构钢　jiegougang which means Structural Steel.</description>
