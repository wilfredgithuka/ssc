    <p>
      Since this year started my Chinese documentation has suffered alot since I don&rsquo;t have Chinese input in Emacs. I use spacemacs as my primary text editor and really need Chinese input.
Fcitx(Flexible Input Method Framework) currently works with the other apps together with Sogou input but not emacs. I seek to find out why. Running fcitx-diagnose says all is okay except for:
 Config GUI for gtk2: Config GUI for gtk2 not found. &hellip; <a class="read-more" href="/blog/emacs_chinese_input/">&raquo;</a>

      This is one of those posts I write in a Java Coffee house sipping an expensive cup of tea and wondering why am paying so expensive for milk+tea, but anyway its Java, its expensive because its Java, and the environment is awesome.
So I work at a really great Chinese company called AVIC International, Nairobi. My workmates both Kenyan and Chinese are the best I have met so far in my career, they are quite an undertanding group of lads. &hellip; <a class="read-more" href="/blog/linux_in_chinese_environment/">&raquo;</a>

      After a wonderful time at Sotik, the trainees again organaised a trip to Kisumu to see the city and visit Lake Victoria among other attractions on Saturday the 17th November 2018. This time round the Chinese teachers accompanied us. The day was amazing. I have never been to the lakeside city of Kisumu. Our trainees are drawn from different parts of the country and this time the ones who hailed from Kisumu took us on a tour of the city. &hellip; <a class="read-more" href="/blog/kisumu/">&raquo;</a>

      For a while now I have been pondering on how I can add a cover page to my weekly report to make it look more presentable. It will also give me more room to write content that would other have to be dropped onto the next page. This weekend I dug up on my Latex documentation to find out how I can add a cover page. It was however no straight forward as I thought, but I found workarounds. &hellip; <a class="read-more" href="/blog/cover_page_latex/">&raquo;</a>
